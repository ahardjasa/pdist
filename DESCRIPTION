Description: Computes the euclidean distance between rows of a matrix X
    and rows of another matrix Y.  Previously, this could only be done by
    binding the two matrices together and calling 'dist', but this creates
    unnecessary computation by computing the distances between a row of X
    and another row of X, and likewise for Y.  pdist strictly computes
    distances across the two matrices, not within the same matrix, making
    computations significantly faster.
